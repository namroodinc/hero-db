`Article title sentiment analysis` | Uses the AFINN-165 wordlist to perform sentiment analysis on Article titles. Also downrates emotive headlines, such as headlines which are uppercase for some, or all, of the words. According to a _[toolkit](https://fullfact.org/toolkit/)_ provided by [Full Fact](https://fullfact.org) - an Independent factchecking charity based in the UK - _"False news stories often have catchy headlines in all caps with exclamation points. If shocking claims in the headline sound unbelievable, they probably are."_.
