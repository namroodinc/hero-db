`Article title sentiment analysis` | Uses the [AFINN-165](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010) wordlist to perform sentiment analysis on Article titles. Also downrates emotive headlines, such as headlines which contain uppercase letters for some, or all, of the words. Validation according to a _[toolkit](https://fullfact.org/toolkit/)_ provided by [Full Fact](https://fullfact.org) - an Independent fact-checking charity based in the United Kingdom - _"False news stories often have catchy headlines in all caps with exclamation points. If shocking claims in the headline sound unbelievable, they probably are."_.
`Independent Press Regulation` | Returns a score based on decisions by an Independent Press Regulator on complaints made against the Publication. The decisions taken into account for calculation are: 'Resolved', 'Upheld', 'Not Upheld', 'Sufficient Remedial Action' was taken by the Publication, or that there was 'No finding'. Currently only return historical decisions from [The Press Complaints Commission (PCC)](http://www.pcc.org.uk/) _(closed in September 2014)_, and its successor: the [Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO)](https://www.ipso.co.uk/).
