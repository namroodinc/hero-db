`Article title sentiment analysis` | Uses the [AFINN-165](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010) wordlist to perform sentiment analysis on Article titles. Also downrates emotive headlines, such as headlines which contain uppercase letters for some, or all, of the words. Validation of this rating is supported by various Independent fact-checking organisations, such as [Full Fact](https://fullfact.org) - an Independent fact-checking charity based in the United Kingdom. _"False news stories often have catchy headlines in all caps with exclamation points. If shocking claims in the headline sound unbelievable, they probably are."_ (_[Full Fact Toolkit](https://fullfact.org/toolkit/)_)
`Independent Press Regulation` | Returns a score based on decisions by an Independent Press Regulator on complaints made against the Publication. The decisions taken into account for the calculation are: 'Resolved', 'Upheld', 'Not Upheld', 'Sufficient Remedial Action' taken by the Publication, or that there was 'No finding' against the Publication. Currently only returns historical decisions from [The Press Complaints Commission (PCC)](http://www.pcc.org.uk/) _(closed in September 2014)_, and its successor: the [Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO)](https://www.ipso.co.uk/).
